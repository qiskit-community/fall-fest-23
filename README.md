# Qiskit Fall Fest 2023

# This is a template that you can use to host your own event

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for MYCAMPUS. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the [Awesome Quantum Club at MYCAMPUS](https://qiskit.org), please consider joining our club. We meet every Tuesday in Room A112.

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from IBM Quantum. Student leaders work alongside IBM to design and plan their event, which are then run in the Fall on their local campus. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on MYCAMPUS is going to be a hackathon, starting on October XX. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is October XX, at XXpm ET. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!
